Quick README

This repository contains code for simulating operations in the assembly model of brain computation.
This codebase has been adapted from the original authors, and converted to Python 3 with some notebooks 
for code walkthroughs.  

Use [This Python Notebook](Visualize%20Sims.ipynb), to get a code walk through of simulations which can reproduce 
results seen in the [paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/25/14464)
